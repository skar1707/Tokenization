# Tokenization
String Tokenisation

This is a small code sample which helps a programmer to change the directory.

For Example if the input is provided as: FILE=/a/b/c/d/e/file.txt then it can be converted as FILE=/a/b/c/d/shubh/file.txt

Note here I have defined shubh as #define DIRNAME "shubh" in the code so it is changing the input path as shubh/file.txt
